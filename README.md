Hey everyone!

I am really new to the tech space and am interested in building real-world projects with tangible impacts. 

I don't know how or where to start, so I guess I'll just begin and figure it all out from there!!!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to deploy ML algorithms and create projects

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with coming up with new project ideas.
